\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Contains the definition of the \doxylink{classDistance}{Distance} class. 

This file defines the \doxylink{classDistance}{Distance} class, which represents the distance between two locations. The class stores both driving and walking distances between two specific locations and provides methods to retrieve these distances and the locations.
