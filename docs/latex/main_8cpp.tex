\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Main function of the program. 

This function serves as the entry point of the program. It loads the necessary data sets, initializes the graph representing the city map, and then presents the user with a menu to choose the type of route to calculate. The program\textquotesingle{}s execution is then concluded by deleting the graph object to free allocated memory.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Loads the locations from the "{}\+Locations.\+csv"{} file.
\item Loads the distances from the "{}\+Distances.\+csv"{} file.
\item Initializes the graph that represents the city map.
\item Starts a menu, calling the {\ttfamily choose\+Route} function to allow the user to select a route, which will call {\ttfamily choose\+Mode} to select a menu mode.
\item Frees the dynamically allocated memory used by the graph object.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
