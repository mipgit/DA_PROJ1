\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the abstract \doxylink{classRoute}{Route} class for calculating routes between a source and destination. 

This file defines the abstract class {\ttfamily \doxylink{classRoute}{Route}}, which serves as a base class for different types of route calculations (\doxylink{classEdge_a65bcda45fc447af2ef58b467cce63eca}{e.\+g}., independent, restricted, eco-\/friendly). It provides a common interface for handling the calculation and processing of routes based on a source and destination on a city map. Derived classes are expected to implement specific route processing and data handling (\doxylink{classEdge_a65bcda45fc447af2ef58b467cce63eca}{e.\+g}., reading and writing routes from/to files).

The \doxylink{classRoute}{Route} class relies on a graph representation of locations ({\ttfamily \doxylink{classGraph}{Graph}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\doxylink{classLocation}{Location}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}) and supports different modes of transportation (\doxylink{classEdge_a65bcda45fc447af2ef58b467cce63eca}{e.\+g}., driving, driving-\/walking).
